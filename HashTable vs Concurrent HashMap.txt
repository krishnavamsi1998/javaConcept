Assume Hashtable and ConcurrentHashMap are two types of Homes.
Hashtable locks home's main door.
ConcurrentHashMap locks specific room door instead of main door.

Hashtable uses single lock for whole data. ConcurrentHashMap uses multiple locks on segment level (16 by default) instead of object level i.e. whole Map.

ConcurrentHashMap allows concurrent read and thread-safe update operations. To perform read operation thread wonâ€™t require any lock but to perform update operation thread require a lock, but it is the lock of only a particular part of Map(Bucket level lock). 

The value null is not allowed for both keys and values. While one thread is iterating the other thread can perform update operation and ConcurrentHashMap never throws  ConcurrentModificationException.
