
Abstract Class					Interface

1.It contains both abstract and			1.It contains only abstract methods
non-abstract methods

2.May have final , non-final 			2.Have only public ,final & static by	
static , non static variables			 default

3.can achieve partial abstraction 		3.can achieve full abstraction

4.abstract classes are extended			4.Interfaces are implemented

5.cannot implement multiple inheritance		5.can implement multiple inheritance


why interface variable are public , static , final ?

public : It happen some-times that interface might placed in some other package. So it need to access the variable from anywhere in project.

static : As such incomplete class can not create object. So in project we need to access the variable without object so we can access with the help of interface_filename.variable_name

final : Suppose one interface implements by many class and all classes try to access and update the interface variable. So it leads to inconsistent of changing data and affect every other class. So it need to declare access modifier with final.
