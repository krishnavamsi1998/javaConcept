Thread :

It is a light weight sub process and is the smallest unit of processing

They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.

Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.

Multi threading : multiple threads running at same time 

Advantages of Java Multithreading
1) It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.

2) You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.

3) Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.

Threads share the same address space.
A thread is lightweight.
Cost of communication between the thread is low.


Java provides Thread class to achieve thread programming. Thread class provides constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread. Thread class extends Object class and implements Runnable interface.
